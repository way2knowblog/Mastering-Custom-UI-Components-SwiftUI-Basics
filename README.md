# Mastering Custom UI Components in SwiftUI
Project by **[Way2KnowBlog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwePLxwase4e6xN_73dTT8w)**

This project dives into creating advanced custom UI components in SwiftUI, showcasing techniques for building interactive buttons, dynamic progress bars, and draggable elements.


# üì± Project Overview
This repository contains three custom SwiftUI components:
1. CustomButtonView - A button with animation effects that reacts to a long-press gesture.
2. ProgressBarView - A dynamic progress bar that increases with button clicks and resets upon completion.
3. DraggableCircleView - An interactive draggable circle that resets position with a spring animation.

By studying these components, you'll learn to apply basic animations, gestures, and state management in SwiftUI to create smooth, user-friendly custom UI elements.



# üõ†Ô∏è Components Breakdown
# CustomButtonView
* A button that scales and changes color based on long-press interaction.
* Implements a spring animation for smooth scaling.
* Customizable colors and animations for a responsive UI.
# ProgressBarView
* A progress bar that fills based on state, featuring smooth, animated transitions.
* Includes a reset function once the progress reaches 100%.
* Conditional button text, changing to "RESET Progress" upon completion.
# DraggableCircleView
* A circle view that allows users to drag it around the screen.
* Resets to its initial position with a spring animation when released.
* Demonstrates DragGesture and smooth resetting for a natural feel.
